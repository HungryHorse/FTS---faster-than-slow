You receive a distress call from a small ship caught in the orbit of a nearby planet with a white hot surface made up entirely of swirling spitting pools of magma. Low on fuel and overfilled after a rescue mission, the small vessel lacks the power to push against the planets gravitational force. Stuck so close the the planet, the tin ship is rapidly heating up; without swift aid, they’re bound to fry.
Use your ship to tow theirs out of safety, and offer up space to their refugees in order to prevent this kind of incident in the future.
